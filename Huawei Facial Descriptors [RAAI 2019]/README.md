Small 3 days hackathon during RAAI summer school (http://school-raai.org/)

<b>Kaggle:</b> https://www.kaggle.com/c/metric-learning/overview

<b>Presentation and repository:</b> https://github.com/papermsucode/raai2019hackface/blob/master/Metric%20learning%20for%20facial%20descriptors.pdf

<b>Results:</b> public 14/29, private 15/29

<b>Description:</b>
In this competition, you should create your own metric between embeddings of the faces. The target is to get such a function which returns small values for the pairs of embeddings from the one class and big values for the pairs of embeddings from different classes. Embeddings have been obtained using deep CNN trained using the softmax.
